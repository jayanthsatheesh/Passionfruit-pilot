# PassionFruit v2 Prototype

This project is a lightweight, dependency-free web application prototype built from a Product Requirements Document (PRD). It is created using only vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with no external frameworks or libraries.

## Tech Stack

*   **HTML**: For the structure and content of the web pages.
*   **CSS**: For styling the application, including a "Muslin Prototype" aesthetic and dark mode.
*   **JavaScript**: For any interactive elements (currently none, but can be added).

## How to Run

To run this prototype, simply open any of the `.html` files in your web browser. There is no need for a local server or any build steps.

## File Structure

*   `index.html`: The main landing page for discovery.
*   `item-details.html`: A page to view the details of a specific item.
*   `booking.html`: The page for the booking process.
*   `profile.html`: A page for user profiles.
